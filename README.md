# HARMONIC-MOTION-TRACING-PATTERNS-IN-A-ROTATING-FIELD
In the "Harmonic Motion: Tracing Patterns in a Rotating Field" project, patterns created by particles or objects moving harmonically inside a rotating reference frame are examined and shown. This will include simulating and mathematically modeling the motion of particles under forces that result in harmonic oscillations.

Objective:
The project aims to trace and analyze the patterns formed in a rotating field by detecting objects using an ultrasonic sensor. The output is visualized as a semicircular pattern with spikes that represent the presence and number of objects within the scanned area.

Components Used:

(1)Ultrasonic Sensor:
Purpose: The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance to objects by emitting sound waves and detecting the echoes that bounce back.
Functionality: As the sensor rotates, it continuously sends out pulses and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. This data is then used to calculate the distance to the nearest object.

(2)Stepper Motor:
Purpose: The stepper motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor at a controlled speed.
Functionality: Stepper motors move in discrete steps, allowing precise control over the angle of rotation. In this project, the motor rotates the sensor, enabling it to scan the surrounding area and collect distance data at various angles.

(3)Arduino UNO-R3 Board:
Purpose: The Arduino UNO serves as the control unit, managing the operation of the stepper motor and the ultrasonic sensor.
Functionality: The board is programmed to coordinate the sensor's measurements with the motor's rotation. It processes the data in real-time and sends it to MATLAB for further analysis and visualization.

Software Used--->MATLAB:
Purpose: MATLAB is used to process and visualize the data collected by the Arduino.
Functionality: The MATLAB code, when dumped into the Arduino, allows for the real-time processing of distance measurements. The output is a semicircular plot where the radius represents the distance measured by the sensor at each angle of rotation. Spikes in the plot indicate the presence of objects.

Working Principle:

Initialization:
The Arduino initializes the stepper motor and ultrasonic sensor.
MATLAB code is dumped into the Arduino, configuring it to control the motor's rotation and to process the sensor data.

Scanning Process:
The stepper motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor in a semicircular path, typically covering 180 degrees.
At each step, the sensor emits a sound wave and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. This time is converted into a distance value.

Data Processing:
The Arduino collects the distance data for each angle of rotation.
This data is transmitted to MATLAB, where it's processed and used to generate a semicircular plot.

Pattern Visualization:
The semicircular plot represents the scanned area, with the radius of each point corresponding to the measured distance at that angle.
Spikes in the plot indicate objects within the sensor's range. The height of each spike represents the distance to the object, allowing for a visual count of the objects.

Output and Analysis:

Semicircular Pattern: The output is a semicircular plot that maps the scanned area. Each point on the plot represents the distance measurement at a specific angle.

Spikes: The presence of spikes in the plot indicates the detection of objects. The number of spikes correlates with the number of objects within the sensor's range.

Interpretation: By analyzing the pattern, you can determine the number, position, and relative distance of objects in the scanned area.

Applications:

This project has potential applications in various fields, such as:
Robotics: For obstacle detection and navigation.
Surveillance: To monitor the presence of objects or intruders in a specific area.
Mapping: For creating a simple map of an environment by detecting and plotting obstacles.
Challenges and Considerations:
Sensor Accuracy: The accuracy of the ultrasonic sensor can be affected by factors like the surface material of objects and environmental conditions.
Motor Precision: The stepper motor's precision is crucial for accurate scanning and pattern tracing.
Data Processing: The real-time processing of data and visualization in MATLAB requires efficient code and synchronization with the Arduino.
