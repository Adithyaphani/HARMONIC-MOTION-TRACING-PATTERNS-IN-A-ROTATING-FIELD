# HARMONIC-MOTION-TRACING-PATTERNS-IN-A-ROTATING-FIELD
In the "Harmonic Motion: Tracing Patterns in a Rotating Field" project, patterns created by particles or objects moving harmonically inside a rotating reference frame are examined and shown. This will include simulating and mathematically modeling the motion of particles under forces that result in harmonic oscillations.
